Operation:
1)  Press connect to connect to the Lynx system.  If the detector is already acquiring, press Start/Stop once to disable it.

2)  Change the file name to the desired name/location.  (e.g. C:/Documents/output to save a text file by the name of output (output.txt) in the C:/Documents folder.)  DO NOT USE BACKSLASHES IN ADDRESSES (Use /, not \).

3)  Check the high voltage.  If the high voltage box isn't green, hit "HV Control Enable" and then "HV On" in succession quickly.  Wait until it is green before moving on.

4)  Press Start/Stop.

5)  Press Start/Stop again to stop acquisition.

6)  To restart acquisition, simply press Start/Stop again.  The program will not overwrite existing files.  It will simply add on to the end of it.

Output data will be formated as follows: Each line will have two numbers separated by a tab - the first is the bin number (uncalibrated energy) and the second is an arbitrary timestamp in seconds (relative to May 1st 2012, 12:00:00am).
